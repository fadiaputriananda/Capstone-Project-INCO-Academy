# Capstone-Project-INCO-Academy
This project aims to demonstrate data manipulation, including data cleaning, data transformation, and data visualization. The data source was taken from Kaggle, and it was a synthetic dataset or no real data that was created by the 'Faker' library from Python.

The dataset has 1000 rows of uncleaned data and 12 columns. But after data processing, the dataset has 1000 rows and 13 columns.
The project details have been uploaded to the pitch deck on Canva.
